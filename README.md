## ðŸš€ Editing & Deploying

Follow these steps whenever you want to update your portfolio after cloning the repo.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run locally If needed (development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a local dev server at:

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

Edit files inside the src/ folder (e.g., App.jsx, index.css) and see changes live.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

> **Note:** This generates a dist/ folder with the optimized static files.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

> **Note:** This pushes the contents of dist/ to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages uses to host your site.
